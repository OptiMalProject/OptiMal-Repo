# OptiMal Representation Methods

Welcome to the OptiMal project repository! This repository contains various methods for representing data in machine learning tasks, developed as part of the Online Procedural Content Generation via Multi-objective Optimisation and Learning (OptiMal) project.

## Overview
The OptiMal project aims to develop generative AI algorithms capable of creating multimodal content with multi-dimensional diversity, aware of human behavior, and adaptable to human experience. This repository includes implementations of several data representation methods essential for preprocessing data before feeding it into machine learning models. The methods covered include:

- Random Seed Generation
- One-Hot Encoding
- Chromosome Variants
- Artificial Neural Networks (AEs, CNNs, Transformers)
- Text Prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Heatmaps (2D and 3D)
- Sequence Mining (Frequent Subsequences)
- N-grams
- Markov Chains
- Non-ANN Gaussian Models
- Graph-based Representations

## Repository Structure

## Project Goals
* Representation of Multi-modal Content: Investigate low-dimensional representations of single modalities and multi-modal content to enhance generalizability and reduce dimensionality.
* Human Behavior-aware Online Content Generation: Develop reinforcement learning methods to generate real-time content that aligns with dynamically changing demands and human behavior.
* Multi-dimensionality of Content Diversity: Explore multi-dimensional content diversity and design generative models using multi-objective optimization to create novel content.
* Game-based Evaluation: Evaluate OptiMal methods extensively within the context of digital games to assess their efficiency, robustness, and computational capabilities.
