    "# Markov Chains\n",
    "Markov Chain is a very important concept in the field of machine learning. It is defined as a random process that transitions from one state to another in the state space. That is, at each step of the Markov chain, the system can choose to change their state to a different one or remain the same according to a probability distribution. A change in state is called a transition, and the probabilities associated with different state changes are called transition probabilities. The probability distribution of the process depends only on the current state, not the events preceding it. This is known as the 'memoryless property' as well as the 'Markov property'. With this property, the modeling process of many problems is greatly simplified as it reduces complex dependencies to only one state.\n",

    "Let's try a more complex example on a Super Mario Bros level. First, read our prepared SMB level from \"/emamples\" file. A Markov chain model is constructed based on these level data. The code generates a Markov chain representing the probability of state transitions by recording how often a particular tile appears in different states. In this notebook, we only used one level as training data, more level can be added to this process to obtain a better result.
