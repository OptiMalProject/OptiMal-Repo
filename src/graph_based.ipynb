    "Graph is a type of data structure as well as a way of explaining the relationship between objects. The key components in a graph are nodes (or vertices) and edges (or links). Nodes represent for the objects needs to be considered in a model, such as cities in a traffic network. Edges represent the connection between nodes, such as distances between cities. \n",

    "- Try graph-based representation if you want to effectively demonstrate a structure of a system and analyze its complex relationships.\n",
    "- If you choose to represent your data in graph, check the number of edges and nodes. If the number of edges is much smaller than the square of the number of vertices, it is viewed as a sparse graph. Use adjacency list is more efficient. For dense graphs or situations you need to quickly query the edges between nodes, use adjacency matrix.\n",
